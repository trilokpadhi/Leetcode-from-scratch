    "### Array\n",
    "In Python, an array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. However, it's important to note that Python doesn't have a built-in array data type like some other programming languages. Instead, Python provides several alternatives:\n",
    "Lists: The most commonly used \"array-like\" structure in Python. Lists are dynamic and can store elements of different types.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: A library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",

    "Two pointers is really a concept rather than an algorithm. It's a way to use two pointers to traverse a data structure, typically a list or an array. The idea is that you have two pointers, one starting at the beginning of the data structure and the other starting at the end. You then move the pointers towards each other until they meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two pointers can be used to \n",
    "- **find a pair of elements in a list that add up to a given sum.** \n",
    "For example, if you have a list of numbers and you want to find two numbers that add up to 10, you can use two pointers to traverse the list. The pointer at the beginning of the list will start at the first number and the pointer at the end of the list will start at the last number. You then move the pointers towards each other until you find a pair of numbers that add up to 10.\n",
    "Two Sum : https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ - Given a sorted array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "            right -= 1\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "We initialize two pointers: left at the start of the array and right at the end. We then move the pointers towards each other until we find a pair of numbers that add up to the target sum. We move the left pointer to the right if the sum of the two numbers is less than the target sum, and we move the right pointer to the left if the sum of the two numbers is greater than the target sum. If we don't find such a pair, we return None.\n",
    "This is a O(n) solution because we are traversing the list only once. and space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space. \n",
    "This will not work if the array is not sorted.\n",
    "*If the array isnt sorted*, we can use a hashmap to store the index of each element and then check if the complement of the current element (target - current element) exists in the hashmap. If it does, we return the indices of the two numbers. If it doesn't, we add the current element to the hashmap.\n",
